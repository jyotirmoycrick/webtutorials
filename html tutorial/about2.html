Story of us: Imagine you are sitting in a packed class, and the teacher is explaining an important concept. It appears that
everyone else is understanding the teacher's words and nodding their head in unison, but this is not the same with you because you
cannot understand an inch of the explanation going on in the class. Does this scenario resonate with you? Whether you accept it or
not, such situations have happened at least once in a student's life. Every person has his or her pace of learning, and it is not
possible for the teacher to take care of each one in the class.

Thankfully, the Edtech sector is growing fast enough to fill this gap. And talking about Edtech in India, one name that can't be
missed is ABCD tutorial. Read on to find out how an engineer's passion for teaching led him to start the world's most valued ed-tech
company

Education is the backbone of a country. It is an integral tool that aids the development of human civilization. <br>Education equips the nation with the workforce, uplifts awareness among the general public, and promotes national unity.

A life without education is valueless. Education makes oneself-sufficient, knowledgeable, intelligent, independent and boosts self-confidence.<br> It enhances our thought process and enables us to do things creatively and correctly.

Education promotes national unity through the contributions of the diverse workforce such as Lawyers, Doctors,<br> Engineers, Judges, Administrative officials, Teachers, Economists, and other technical hands.

John Amos Comenius is crowned as the ‘Father of Modern Education’, who put forth various kinds and forms of education. According to John Amos,<br> education is not confined within the classrooms. He has written various education theories, methods, and systems which states that illusions as students cannot be learned only by reading.

A teacher is a person with commendable skills for helping others learn, guiding, and helping solve a problem. Teachers should have excellent communication skills<br> so that the students can understand everything and learn with ease. Teachers have several credentials as per their designation or where they are teaching.

Our parents also, to an extent, qualify as teachers, even though unprofessional, but they still work hard to guide us in our and pledge to help us from or even before when we are born.<br> Teachers also grow with the experience they get while years of teaching in an institution. Teachers see many generations growing in front of them and<br> most times, become a significant factor in sculpting their personalities.

One might wonder how hard being a teacher might be, but let me tell you it is not an easy task. Being a teacher involved being proficient in their matter of teaching and also being<br> very good with explaining the concepts with ease, other than this, a teacher will also have tremendous <br>observing skills to understand the progress of each student and work on changes with the dynamic education system at present.

Other than this, being a teacher also means being able to test your students’ knowledge, and proficiency on the matter taught and later helping those who couldn’t <br>understand clearly from the results of the evaluation. Hence, to better express<br> the importance of teachers, in the Hindu religion, the ‘Guru’ is often given the same pedestal as that of God and parents. The contribution behind one’s success will always be a teacher.
